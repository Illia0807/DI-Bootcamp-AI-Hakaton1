Project Proposal – AI-Based Personalized Content Generator

Hi Yosef

As part of the upcoming Hackathon project, I would like to pursue Topic 1: AI-Based Personalized Content Generator.

🔍 Intentions and Motivation
My goal is to create a Python-based system that recommends personalized content (such as books, music, and daily tips) based on synthetic user profiles and activity logs.
 This project combines logic, creativity, and data analysis — an ideal match for my ENTP personality and my interest in generative AI.

This project also resonates with real-world applications of generative AI, a field I am particularly interested in exploring further.

🎯 Desired Outcome
By the end of the project, I aim to deliver a working system that:

Collects and analyzes synthetic user data (e.g., name, age, interests, activity logs);

Performs trend analysis using Pandas and SciPy (e.g., distribution of interests, user similarity);

Generates content recommendations based on user interests and behavioral patterns;

Visualizes trends and insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn (e.g., interest heatmaps, bar charts by segment);

Applies additional statistical methods (e.g., chi-square test or cosine similarity) to model more nuanced logic in user clustering or behavior prediction.-perhabs

Looking forward to your feedback and any suggestions you may have regarding the direction of the project.

Sincerely,
[Illia Andriienko]
